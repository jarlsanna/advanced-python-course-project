# Code project in the course Advanced Scientific Programming in Python at UU

This project is about structuring our code for remotely controlling the sputtering machine in the lab, as well as process data from the experiments. 
Currently all the code is just a collection of functions, and the aim of this project is to organize the code in a better way such as into classes, 
document is well and also trying to optimize it to be faster.
